    <h1>Japan's Financial Crisis Discussion</h1>
    
    <p>The radio program featured an emergency discussion between Miki Watanabe and Takeshi Fujimaki (described as a "legendary dealer" and House of Councilors member) about Japan's rising long-term interest rates, which reached 1.45% in February 2025â€”the highest level in 15 years.</p>

    <h2>Key Points About Japan's Economic Situation:</h2>

    <h3>1. Rising Interest Rates</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>February 2025 saw long-term interest rates reaching 1.45%, the highest in 15 years</li>
        <li>BOJ Governor Ueda tried to intervene to calm the market</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Bank of Japan's Precarious Position</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>BOJ holds more than half of all Japanese Government Bonds (JGBs)</li>
        <li>The central bank faces significant valuation losses (estimated at 2.9 trillion yen with just a 0.1% rise in rates)</li>
        <li>These losses threaten to undermine trust in the central bank</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Market Liquidity Problems</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Fujimaki expressed concern about market liquidity, noting "you can't sell when you want to sell"</li>
        <li>This creates a dangerous situation, especially for "salaried traders" in Japan</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4. BOJ's Fiscal Policy Dilemma</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>BOJ has purchased approximately 95% of JGBs since 2013</li>
        <li>They face a contradictory situation: to fight inflation they should stop buying bonds or raise rates, but doing so would crash bond prices and increase their losses</li>
        <li>Governor Ueda stated they would increase JGB purchases if rates rise sharply, which Fujimaki called "outrageous" and "feeding oil into the fire" of inflation</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5. Interest Rate Imbalance</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The BOJ is described as making a fundamental error by "raising short-term interest rates but investing long-term"</li>
        <li>This is compared to the Silicon Valley Bank failure in the US</li>
        <li>The BOJ was described as "the largest long-term investor" putting itself in a situation where it "can't raise policy rates"</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>6. Fiscal Finance Concerns</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Fujimaki noted that "fiscal finance" (central banks financing government spending) is "banned all over the world" because it leads to these kinds of problems</li>
        <li>Both speakers express concern that Japan has reached its limit in this approach</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>7. The Yen's Value</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The yen was touching 148 yen to the dollar at the time of recording</li>
        <li>Fujimaki advised listeners to protect themselves by "buying dollars" rather than depending on the government and BOJ</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="highlight">
        <h3>8. Analogy Used</h3>
        <p>Fujimaki compared Japan's situation to discussing "whether it is high tide or low tide" while a tsunami warning has been issued. He warned that financial collapse could "come overnight" and not to be distracted by small market movements.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>9. International Perception</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Watanabe predicted that "the international community will give up on the Bank of Japan" due to Governor Ueda's policies</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Both speakers appeared extremely concerned about Japan's financial situation, describing it as a crisis with no clear solution, and suggested that Japan's debt situation has become "radical" with limited options remaining.</p>
