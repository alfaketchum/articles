<h1>Ben Thompson&rsquo;s Aggregation Theory and Christensen&rsquo;s Disruption: An Evolution in Strategy</h1>
<p>Ben Thompson&rsquo;s <strong>Aggregation Theory</strong> is a framework that reinterprets how businesses succeed in the Internet age, and it is deeply influenced by Clayton Christensen&rsquo;s <strong>Disruption Theory</strong>. Thompson, the author of the Stratechery blog, has explicitly credited Christensen as a major influence on his work (<a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/clayton-christensen-passes-away-professor-christensen-and-i-kobe-bryant-and-measuring-your-life/#:~:text=There%20is%20no%20greater%20influence,me%20of%20what%20truly%20matters">Clayton Christensen Passes Away, Professor Christensen and I, Kobe Bryant and Measuring Your Life &ndash; Stratechery by Ben Thompson</a>). By building on Christensen&rsquo;s ideas &ndash; and addressing where they fall short in the context of modern tech &ndash; Thompson developed Aggregation Theory to explain the rise of companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Apple. This analysis will explore how Aggregation Theory draws from Christensen&rsquo;s Disruption Theory, and how Thompson applies it to today&rsquo;s tech giants. Key concepts such as demand aggregation, direct user relationships, and network effects will be highlighted to show how aggregators differ from traditional supply-centric businesses.</p>
<h2>Christensen&rsquo;s Disruption Theory as a Foundation</h2>
<p><strong>Clayton Christensen&rsquo;s Disruption Theory</strong> (from <em>The Innovator&rsquo;s Dilemma</em>, 1997) describes how new entrants can topple incumbents by starting at the low end or in new markets and moving upward. As Christensen famously summarized, <strong>disruptive innovation</strong> &ldquo;describes a process whereby a smaller company with fewer resources is able to successfully challenge established incumbent businesses&rdquo; by targeting overlooked or low-end segments, then progressing to mainstream markets (<a href="https://stratechery.com/2025/american-disruption/#:~:text=,require%2C%20while%20preserving%20the%20advantages">American Disruption &ndash; Stratechery by Ben Thompson</a>). Incumbents, focused on serving their most profitable customers, overshoot the needs of some consumers and leave an opening for simpler, cheaper solutions from disruptors (<a href="https://stratechery.com/2025/american-disruption/#:~:text=,move%20upmarket%2C%20delivering%20the%20performance">American Disruption &ndash; Stratechery by Ben Thompson</a>). When the upstarts improve over time and attract the incumbents&rsquo; core customers, <strong>disruption</strong> has occurred (<a href="https://stratechery.com/2025/american-disruption/#:~:text=needs%20of%20some%20segments%20and,in%20volume%2C%20disruption%20has%20occurred">American Disruption &ndash; Stratechery by Ben Thompson</a>). This theory became highly influential in business and in Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>Ben Thompson was an avid student of Christensen&rsquo;s work. He noted that <strong>&ldquo;there is no greater influence on Stratechery than Professor Clayton Christensen&rdquo;</strong> (<a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/clayton-christensen-passes-away-professor-christensen-and-i-kobe-bryant-and-measuring-your-life/#:~:text=There%20is%20no%20greater%20influence,me%20of%20what%20truly%20matters">Clayton Christensen Passes Away, Professor Christensen and I, Kobe Bryant and Measuring Your Life &ndash; Stratechery by Ben Thompson</a>). Thompson even took a class on Christensen&rsquo;s ideas, finding them illuminating &ndash; yet he also noticed certain cases that didn&rsquo;t fit. In particular, <strong>Apple</strong> was a puzzle for disruption theory. Christensen had repeatedly predicted that Apple&rsquo;s integrated products (from the iPod to the iPhone) would eventually lose out to more modular, &ldquo;good enough&rdquo; alternatives &ndash; yet Apple kept winning. Thompson pointed out that Christensen&rsquo;s theory <strong>&ldquo;does not incorporate the importance of the user experience&rdquo;</strong>, a factor that allowed Apple to defy low-end disruption (<a href="https://stratechery.com/concept/disruption-theory/the-innovators-dilemma/#:~:text=Image%3A%20What%20Clayton%20Christensen%20Got,Wrong">The Innovator&rsquo;s Dilemma &ndash; Stratechery by Ben Thompson</a>). In a Stratechery article titled <em>What Clayton Christensen Got Wrong</em>, Thompson argued that a <em>superior user experience</em> can sustain a premium position indefinitely because consumers never consider a product &ldquo;too good&rdquo; (<a href="https://stratechery.com/2013/clayton-christensen-got-wrong/#:~:text=,it%20comes%20to%20the%20user">What Clayton Christensen Got Wrong &ndash; Stratechery by Ben Thompson</a>) (<a href="https://stratechery.com/2013/clayton-christensen-got-wrong/#:~:text=because%20of%20a%20superior%20user,comes%20to%20their%20prime%20differentiation">What Clayton Christensen Got Wrong &ndash; Stratechery by Ben Thompson</a>). This insight &ndash; that <strong>demand-side preferences like user experience can trump the supply-side drive toward commoditization</strong> &ndash; informed Thompson&rsquo;s evolution beyond classical disruption theory.</p>
<p>Christensen himself acknowledged that &ldquo;disruption&rdquo; was often misapplied, especially as a buzzword. In 2015, he noted many cases didn&rsquo;t meet the strict definition (e.g. he argued Uber was <strong>not</strong> truly disruptive because it started in a high-end market, not a low-end foothold) (<a href="https://stratechery.com/2015/beyond-disruption/#:~:text=Indeed%2C%20for%20all%20that%20the,start%20out%20by%20undercutting%20taxis">Beyond Disruption &ndash; Stratechery by Ben Thompson</a>) (<a href="https://stratechery.com/2015/beyond-disruption/#:~:text=In%20fact%2C%20Christensen%20understates%20his,company%20is%20actually%20moving%20in">Beyond Disruption &ndash; Stratechery by Ben Thompson</a>). Thompson seized on such examples to illustrate the limits of disruption theory in the Internet era. In his article <em>Beyond Disruption</em>, Thompson agreed with Christensen&rsquo;s Uber point and observed that <strong>&ldquo;disruption theory often doesn&rsquo;t make sense when it comes to understanding how companies succeed in the age of the Internet.&rdquo;</strong> (<a href="https://stratechery.com/aggregation-theory/#:~:text=Clayton%20Christensen%20claims%20that%20Uber,the%20age%20of%20the%20Internet">Aggregation Theory &ndash; Stratechery by Ben Thompson</a>) There were hugely successful tech companies that did <strong>not</strong> follow the classic disruptor pattern. Instead of coming from below with an inferior but cheaper product, companies like Google, Facebook, and others seemed to start at the <em>high end</em> or center of the market, often with <strong>superior products or services</strong>, and still managed to upend industries. Thompson set out to explain this <strong>new breed of company</strong> that didn&rsquo;t fit Christensen&rsquo;s mold &ndash; and in doing so, he built directly on Christensen&rsquo;s frameworks to formulate <strong>Aggregation Theory</strong>.</p>
<h2>The Emergence of Aggregation Theory</h2>
<p>By 2015, Thompson synthesized his ideas into what he called <em>Aggregation Theory</em>, explicitly framing it as an evolution of Christensen&rsquo;s concepts for the Internet age. In a series of Stratechery articles, he traced a common thread and &ldquo;placed this commodification/aggregation concept into Clay Christensen&rsquo;s <strong>Conservation of Attractive Profits</strong> framework&rdquo; (<a href="https://stratechery.com/2015/aggregation-theory/#:~:text=,also%20fit%20the%20%E2%80%9CConservation%20of">Aggregation Theory &ndash; Stratechery by Ben Thompson</a>). (The <em>law of Conservation of Attractive Profits</em>, introduced by Christensen, states that when one layer of an industry value chain becomes commoditized, the opportunity to earn profits shifts to an adjacent layer that is still differentiated (<a href="https://stratechery.com/2015/netflix-and-the-conservation-of-attractive-profits/#:~:text=,emerge%20at%20an%20adjacent%20stage">Netflix and the Conservation of Attractive Profits &ndash; Stratechery by Ben Thompson</a>).) Thompson observed that this is exactly what was happening in tech: the Internet was commoditizing the traditional points of control (such as distribution and supply), and profits were migrating to new points &ndash; namely, to companies that aggregated the demand side of the market (<a href="https://stratechery.com/2015/aggregation-theory/#:~:text=,also%20fit%20the%20%E2%80%9CConservation%20of">Aggregation Theory &ndash; Stratechery by Ben Thompson</a>) (<a href="https://stratechery.com/2015/aggregation-theory/#:~:text=Attractive%20Profits%20framework%2C%20which%20states,part%20of%20the%20value%20chain">Aggregation Theory &ndash; Stratechery by Ben Thompson</a>).</p>
<p>Thompson explains that any consumer market&rsquo;s value chain has three parts: <strong>suppliers</strong>, <strong>distributors</strong>, and <strong>customers/users</strong> (<a href="https://stratechery.com/2015/aggregation-theory/#:~:text=The%20value%20chain%20for%20any,latter%20depended%20on%20controlling%20distribution">Aggregation Theory &ndash; Stratechery by Ben Thompson</a>). In the pre-Internet era, the surest path to market power was to control distribution or supply. Many traditional companies gained <strong>vertical integration</strong> advantages by owning supply and distribution channels. For example, newspapers controlled local distribution of news, so they integrated backwards into content creation (hiring writers, editors) and enjoyed outsize profits as the gatekeepers for both readers and advertisers (<a href="https://stratechery.com/2015/aggregation-theory/#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20printed%20newspapers%20were,integrated%20backwards%20into%20supply%3A%20there">Aggregation Theory &ndash; Stratechery by Ben Thompson</a>) (<a href="https://stratechery.com/2015/aggregation-theory/#:~:text=have%20always%20been%20far%20more,relationship%20provides%20significantly%20more%20leverage">Aggregation Theory &ndash; Stratechery by Ben Thompson</a>). Similar patterns held in industries like book publishing (publishers controlled printing and access to authors), television (networks controlled broadcast distribution and content licensing), and retail (brick-and-mortar retailers controlled shelf space and inventory, giving them leverage over manufacturers) (<a href="https://stratechery.com/2015/aggregation-theory/#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20printed%20newspapers%20were,integrated%20backwards%20into%20supply%3A%20there">Aggregation Theory &ndash; Stratechery by Ben Thompson</a>) (<a href="https://stratechery.com/2015/aggregation-theory/#:~:text=authors%29%2C%20video%20,relationship%20provides%20significantly%20more%20leverage">Aggregation Theory &ndash; Stratechery by Ben Thompson</a>). These <strong>supply-side moats</strong> existed because distribution was costly and limited. In Christensen&rsquo;s terms, incumbents often enjoyed sustained profits by <em>integrating</em> key parts of the value chain and making it hard for outsiders to compete without similar vertical control (<a href="https://stratechery.com/2015/aggregation-theory/#:~:text=profits%20in%20any%20of%20these,latter%20depended%20on%20controlling%20distribution">Aggregation Theory &ndash; Stratechery by Ben Thompson</a>) (<a href="https://stratechery.com/2015/aggregation-theory/#:~:text=authors%29%2C%20video%20,relationship%20provides%20significantly%20more%20leverage">Aggregation Theory &ndash; Stratechery by Ben Thompson</a>).</p>
<p>The Internet, however, <strong>&ldquo;fundamentally changed the plane of competition&rdquo;</strong> (<a href="https://stratechery.com/2015/aggregation-theory/#:~:text=This%20has%20fundamentally%20changed%20the,experience%20in%20a%20virtuous%20cycle">Aggregation Theory &ndash; Stratechery by Ben Thompson</a>). Thompson writes that the Internet&rsquo;s <strong>&ldquo;fundamental disruption&rdquo;</strong> was to <em>turn this dynamic on its head</em>: distribution of information became nearly <strong>free</strong>, and transaction costs dropped to <strong>zero</strong>, removing the traditional advantages of controlling physical distribution (<a href="https://stratechery.com/2015/aggregation-theory/#:~:text=The%20fundamental%20disruption%20of%20the,with%20end%20users%2Fconsumers%20at%20scale">Aggregation Theory &ndash; Stratechery by Ben Thompson</a>). A new kind of company could arise &ndash; one that doesn&rsquo;t own supply in the traditional sense, but instead <em>aggregates</em> consumers at scale by providing a superior service or platform. In the Internet era, a company can integrate <strong>forward</strong> with end users on a global scale, thanks to zero distribution cost and ubiquitous connectivity (<a href="https://stratechery.com/2015/aggregation-theory/#:~:text=The%20fundamental%20disruption%20of%20the,with%20end%20users%2Fconsumers%20at%20scale">Aggregation Theory &ndash; Stratechery by Ben Thompson</a>) (<a href="https://stratechery.com/2015/aggregation-theory/#:~:text=with%20suppliers,with%20end%20users%2Fconsumers%20at%20scale">Aggregation Theory &ndash; Stratechery by Ben Thompson</a>). This flips the script: instead of fighting to lock down scarce suppliers or channels, a business can win by <strong>locking in the demand side</strong> &ndash; by becoming the go-to intermediary for millions or billions of users.</p>
<p>Thompson&rsquo;s Aggregation Theory describes how these <strong>aggregators</strong> operate and why they are so powerful. Unlike a classic disruptor that enters at the low end, an <strong>aggregator often starts by attracting the <em>best</em> customers with a better product or user experience</strong> (often subsidized or free). Thompson explicitly contrasts aggregators with Christensen-style disruptors: <strong>&ldquo;They are not offering low-margin, good-enough products that appeal to over-served customers. Rather, they are &lsquo;aggregators&rsquo; who start with the best customers and don&rsquo;t really compete with incumbent companies, at least in the beginning.&rdquo;</strong> (<a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/the-fang-playbook/#:~:text=They%20are%20not%20offering%20low,In%20fact%2C%20incumbents%20nearly%20universally">The FANG Playbook &ndash; Stratechery by Ben Thompson</a>). In fact, incumbents initially <strong>benefit</strong> from aggregators &ndash; for example, media publishers got additional traffic from Google and Facebook, merchants made sales through Amazon &ndash; so they don&rsquo;t put up a fight (<a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/the-fang-playbook/#:~:text=Note%20that%20none%20of%20these,only%20when%20the%20aggregators%E2%80%99%20consumer">The FANG Playbook &ndash; Stratechery by Ben Thompson</a>). The aggregator rapidly grows its user base, <strong>owning the customer relationship</strong>, and becomes an indispensable gateway between suppliers and consumers. Once the aggregator&rsquo;s user base is dominant, it can <strong>&ldquo;squeeze&rdquo;</strong> the suppliers (e.g. by extracting fees, undercutting prices, or demanding terms) and capture the lion&rsquo;s share of value, in a way that is &ldquo;in the long-run irreversible&rdquo; (<a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/the-fang-playbook/#:~:text=Note%20that%20none%20of%20these,squeeze%20on%20incumbents%20%E2%80%94%20specifically">The FANG Playbook &ndash; Stratechery by Ben Thompson</a>) (<a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/the-fang-playbook/#:~:text=benefit%20from%20the%20presence%20of,run%20irreversible">The FANG Playbook &ndash; Stratechery by Ben Thompson</a>). This is a different path to dominance than the one described in Disruption Theory, but it rhymes with Christensen&rsquo;s broader observation that profits flow to the bottleneck in a value chain. In the Internet age, <strong>the bottleneck is demand</strong>: the attention and engagement of users.</p>
<h2>Key Principles of Aggregation Theory</h2>
<p>Thompson&rsquo;s Aggregation Theory centers on a few key principles that distinguish aggregators from traditional businesses rooted in supply-side economics:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Direct User Relationships and User Experience First:</strong> Aggregators succeed by forging a direct relationship with <strong>end users</strong> and making the <strong>user experience</strong> their top priority. Because distribution costs are near zero online, an aggregator can potentially serve <em>every</em> consumer, so the winner is the firm that attracts and delights the most users (<a href="https://stratechery.com/2015/aggregation-theory/#:~:text=This%20has%20fundamentally%20changed%20the,experience%20in%20a%20virtuous%20cycle">Aggregation Theory &ndash; Stratechery by Ben Thompson</a>). Thompson notes that in this model, <strong>&ldquo;the most important factor determining success is the user experience: the best aggregators win by providing the best experience, which earns them the most users, which attracts the most suppliers, which enhances the user experience in a virtuous cycle.&rdquo;</strong> (<a href="https://stratechery.com/2015/aggregation-theory/#:~:text=consumers%2Fusers%20an%20afterthought,experience%20in%20a%20virtuous%20cycle">Aggregation Theory &ndash; Stratechery by Ben Thompson</a>) This demand-side focus echoes Thompson&rsquo;s point about Apple: a great user experience can be an enduring moat. By contrast, pre-internet distributors treated consumers as an afterthought, focusing on locking in suppliers or content (<a href="https://stratechery.com/2015/aggregation-theory/#:~:text=This%20has%20fundamentally%20changed%20the,experience%20in%20a%20virtuous%20cycle">Aggregation Theory &ndash; Stratechery by Ben Thompson</a>) &ndash; an approach that aggregators upend.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Demand Aggregation (Consolidating Demand at Scale):</strong> The crux of Aggregation Theory is that aggregators <strong>consolidate demand</strong> &ndash; they gather a huge base of customers &ndash; and thereby gain power over supply. Thompson emphasizes that the theory is not saying demand suddenly outweighs supply in importance, but rather that <strong>&ldquo;aggregators consolidate demand to gain power over supply.&rdquo;</strong> (<a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/the-problem-with-aggregation-theory-demand-at-scale-supplier-power-and-value/#:~:text=That%20is%20precisely%20the%20point,to%20gain%20power%20over%20supply">The Problem with &ldquo;Aggregation Theory&rdquo;, Demand at Scale, Supplier Power and Value &ndash; Stratechery by Ben Thompson</a>) In economic terms, aggregators flip the balance of power: instead of suppliers dictating terms because they control scarce goods or distribution, the aggregator controls access to a large concentrated pool of customers. Suppliers, even if plentiful, <em>must</em> work through the aggregator to reach those customers, shifting the leverage and profit potential to the aggregator (<a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/the-problem-with-aggregation-theory-demand-at-scale-supplier-power-and-value/#:~:text=not%20because%20demand%20has%20become,has%20on%20the%20supply%20side%E2%80%A6">The Problem with &ldquo;Aggregation Theory&rdquo;, Demand at Scale, Supplier Power and Value &ndash; Stratechery by Ben Thompson</a>). This is simply a new manifestation of competitive advantage &ndash; as Thompson notes, it aligns with classic ideas like Porter&rsquo;s bargaining power of buyers vs. suppliers (<a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/the-problem-with-aggregation-theory-demand-at-scale-supplier-power-and-value/#:~:text=than%20others%2C%20reflecting%20differences%20in,versa">The Problem with &ldquo;Aggregation Theory&rdquo;, Demand at Scale, Supplier Power and Value &ndash; Stratechery by Ben Thompson</a>) (<a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/the-problem-with-aggregation-theory-demand-at-scale-supplier-power-and-value/#:~:text=,give%20in%20to%20Apple%E2%80%99s%20demands">The Problem with &ldquo;Aggregation Theory&rdquo;, Demand at Scale, Supplier Power and Value &ndash; Stratechery by Ben Thompson</a>) &ndash; but on the internet, the <strong>buyer side (demand)</strong> can concentrate more than ever before.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Zero (or Low) Distribution Costs Enabling Global Scale:</strong> A precondition for aggregators&rsquo; rise is that the Internet dramatically reduced distribution and transaction costs. Thompson stresses that the Internet made distributing digital goods <strong>free</strong> and coordinating transactions <strong>frictionless</strong> (<a href="https://stratechery.com/2015/aggregation-theory/#:~:text=The%20fundamental%20disruption%20of%20the,with%20end%20users%2Fconsumers%20at%20scale">Aggregation Theory &ndash; Stratechery by Ben Thompson</a>). This means an aggregator can serve users globally without needing a traditional supply chain or physical infrastructure in each market (at least for digital services). The result is businesses that can scale <em>almost infinitely</em> &ndash; often with near-zero marginal costs &ndash; which was not possible in the old economy. An aggregator&rsquo;s service is usually available to anyone with an internet connection, giving it access to an unprecedented scale of demand. This often leads to <strong>winner-take-all dynamics</strong>, because the biggest platform can keep improving and extending its reach faster than others. As Thompson observes, these companies &ldquo;are all capable of serving every consumer on earth,&rdquo; and their services actually <strong>get better the more users they serve</strong>, creating self-reinforcing growth (<a href="https://stratechery.com/2015/aggregation-theory/#:~:text=What%20is%20important%20to%20note,the%20public%20and%20private%20markets">Aggregation Theory &ndash; Stratechery by Ben Thompson</a>). Such <strong>network effects</strong> mean that success begets more success: more users attract more suppliers or content, which attracts more users, and so on.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Network Effects and the Virtuous Cycle:</strong> Many aggregators benefit from <strong>network effects</strong> &ndash; the value of the service increases as more people use it or contribute content. Thompson explicitly notes that in all his examples of aggregators, there are <strong>&ldquo;strong winner-take-all effects&rdquo;</strong>: the service improves with scale, and there&rsquo;s effectively no limit to how many users can be served (<a href="https://stratechery.com/2015/aggregation-theory/#:~:text=What%20is%20important%20to%20note,the%20public%20and%20private%20markets">Aggregation Theory &ndash; Stratechery by Ben Thompson</a>). For instance, the more buyers and sellers on Amazon&rsquo;s marketplace, or the more friends and content on Facebook&rsquo;s network, the more useful those platforms become, cementing their leadership. This network-driven virtuous cycle is tightly linked to the demand aggregation point above. It also differentiates aggregators from traditional firms &ndash; a local newspaper or a chain of stores has natural limits to growth and doesn&rsquo;t necessarily get better if it doubles its customers, whereas an online platform often does. <strong>Scale</strong> itself becomes a critical competitive advantage. (Thompson later remarked that scale was an under-appreciated factor in Christensen&rsquo;s original theory &ndash; on the internet, reaching <em>massive</em> scale quickly can matter even more than being low-end or low-cost (<a href="https://stratechery.com/2025/american-disruption/#:~:text=This%20is%20exactly%20what%20happened,to%20both%20components%20and%20assemblers">American Disruption &ndash; Stratechery by Ben Thompson</a>) (<a href="https://stratechery.com/2025/american-disruption/#:~:text=Asia,to%20both%20components%20and%20assemblers">American Disruption &ndash; Stratechery by Ben Thompson</a>).)</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, Aggregation Theory posits that the internet rewards companies that <strong>aggregate demand by delivering superior user experiences at scale, leveraging zero distribution costs and network effects, and then monetize that aggregated attention or engagement</strong>. This leads to a shift in where profits are made: old incumbents that controlled supply or distribution lose out, and new aggregators that control the user interface and customer relationship capture the bulk of value (<a href="https://stratechery.com/2015/aggregation-theory/#:~:text=The%20result%20is%20the%20shift,For%20example">Aggregation Theory &ndash; Stratechery by Ben Thompson</a>). Thompson notes this outcome was exactly <strong>&ldquo;the shift in value predicted by the Conservation of Attractive Profits&rdquo;</strong> &ndash; the locus of profit moves to the part of the value chain that remains integrated when other parts become commoditized (<a href="https://stratechery.com/2015/aggregation-theory/#:~:text=The%20result%20is%20the%20shift,For%20example">Aggregation Theory &ndash; Stratechery by Ben Thompson</a>). In the case of aggregators, they let content or product supply be modular and competitive (often driving those suppliers&rsquo; profits to zero or modest margins), while they integrate the <strong>demand side</strong> (the interface to the consumer) and reap attractive profits there (<a href="https://stratechery.com/2015/aggregation-theory/#:~:text=The%20result%20is%20the%20shift,For%20example">Aggregation Theory &ndash; Stratechery by Ben Thompson</a>).</p>
<h2>Aggregation Theory Applied: Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Apple</h2>
<p>Thompson&rsquo;s framework comes to life in his analysis of today&rsquo;s tech giants. Companies like <strong>Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Apple</strong> have each, in different ways, leveraged Aggregation Theory principles to achieve dominance. Thompson frequently dissects these firms on Stratechery to show how they <strong>aggregate demand, build direct user relationships, and exploit network effects</strong>, setting themselves apart from traditional businesses rooted in controlling supply. Below are examples of how each company applies Aggregation Theory, drawn directly from Thompson&rsquo;s writings:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Google:</strong> Prior to Google, information was often bundled by suppliers (publishers packaged articles into newspapers or magazines). Google effectively <strong>modularized content</strong>, indexing individual web pages and making any single article or site immediately accessible to the user via search (<a href="https://stratechery.com/2015/aggregation-theory/#:~:text=Google">Aggregation Theory &ndash; Stratechery by Ben Thompson</a>). In Thompson&rsquo;s words, <em>&ldquo;Previously, publishers integrated publications and articles. Google modularized individual pages and articles, making them directly accessible via search.&rdquo;</em> (<a href="https://stratechery.com/2015/aggregation-theory/#:~:text=Google">Aggregation Theory &ndash; Stratechery by Ben Thompson</a>) By becoming the starting point for information discovery, Google <strong>owns the consumer entry point</strong> for knowledge on the web (<a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/the-fang-playbook/#:~:text=Last%20July%20I%20described%20the,be%20found%20on%20the%20Internet">The FANG Playbook &ndash; Stratechery by Ben Thompson</a>). Google then <strong>integrated</strong> the demand it aggregated with a monetization machine: it uses data about user intent (search queries) and user profiles to sell highly targeted advertising (<a href="https://stratechery.com/2015/aggregation-theory/#:~:text=,to%20sell%20highly%20effective%20advertising">Aggregation Theory &ndash; Stratechery by Ben Thompson</a>). In doing so, Google commodified the suppliers (web publishers who now compete for Google-driven traffic) and captured the bulk of value in online ads. Google&rsquo;s search engine benefits from scale (more users and searches improve its algorithms, attracting yet more users) and exhibits a form of network effect in advertising (advertisers flock to where the users are). The result is that Google has a <strong>direct relationship with billions of users</strong> who &ldquo;trust&rdquo; Google to route them to information, giving it immense power over content providers. Thompson points out that Google was the pioneer of this aggregator model: by aggregating <em>demand</em> for information, it gained leverage over the <em>supply</em> of content (<a href="https://stratechery.com/2015/aggregation-theory/#:~:text=It%E2%80%99s%20interesting%20to%20consider%20the,collection%20mechanisms%20they%20are.%5E%7B1">Aggregation Theory &ndash; Stratechery by Ben Thompson</a>). Traditional media companies initially gained traffic from Google (thus seeming to benefit), but once Google became the primary gateway for readers, it could dictate terms &ndash; siphoning off advertising dollars that used to go to publishers. This exemplifies Aggregation Theory&rsquo;s dynamic of incumbents becoming dependent on an aggregator that eventually undermines their margins (<a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/the-fang-playbook/#:~:text=Note%20that%20none%20of%20these,only%20when%20the%20aggregators%E2%80%99%20consumer">The FANG Playbook &ndash; Stratechery by Ben Thompson</a>) (<a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/the-fang-playbook/#:~:text=start%20with%20the%20best%20customers,run%20irreversible">The FANG Playbook &ndash; Stratechery by Ben Thompson</a>).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Facebook:</strong> Facebook takes aggregation to an even more extreme level, because its <strong>users themselves are the suppliers of content</strong>. Thompson notes that <em>&ldquo;Facebook...aggregates content that it gets for free&rdquo;</em> from its users, and moreover has <strong>exclusive access</strong> to much of that content (your personal posts or friend updates exist only on Facebook) (<a href="https://stratechery.com/2015/aggregation-theory/#:~:text=Facebook%2C%20though%2C%20has%20built%20in,generated%20content%20networks%20are%20similar">Aggregation Theory &ndash; Stratechery by Ben Thompson</a>). In the old model, publishers combined content and ads in a single product (a newspaper bundled news articles with advertising to make money). Facebook <strong>unbundled</strong> and <strong>modularized attention</strong> &ndash; advertisers can target users directly on Facebook, without any need to be adjacent to specific content (<a href="https://stratechery.com/2015/aggregation-theory/#:~:text=Facebook%20">Aggregation Theory &ndash; Stratechery by Ben Thompson</a>). As Thompson writes, <em>&ldquo;Previously, publishers integrated content and advertisements. Facebook modularized advertisements by allowing advertisers to target customers directly&rdquo;</em>, decoupling ads from particular content outlets (<a href="https://stratechery.com/2015/aggregation-theory/#:~:text=Facebook%20">Aggregation Theory &ndash; Stratechery by Ben Thompson</a>). Facebook then <strong>integrated its massive user base with an advertising platform driven by personal data</strong>: it merged the News Feed (where people spend their time) with an inventory of ad slots enriched by detailed profile data, enabling incredibly effective ad targeting (<a href="https://stratechery.com/2015/aggregation-theory/#:~:text=,to%20sell%20highly%20effective%20advertising">Aggregation Theory &ndash; Stratechery by Ben Thompson</a>). This integration of <strong>user engagement + data + ads</strong> has yielded a digital advertising machine of unprecedented scale. Facebook&rsquo;s power comes from its <strong>network effect</strong> &ndash; each new user adds value by contributing content and connections that keep others on the platform. In Aggregation Theory terms, Facebook created a <em>closed demand ecosystem</em>: billions of users who interact only on Facebook&rsquo;s terms, leaving businesses and media no choice but to go through Facebook to reach that audience. Early on, news sites and game developers gladly used Facebook to acquire traffic or users, effectively outsourcing demand aggregation to Facebook. Over time Facebook&rsquo;s grip tightened &ndash; for example, changes in News Feed algorithms could make or break a publisher. This ability to <strong>mediate the relationship with end-users</strong> and update the rules is the hallmark of an aggregator&rsquo;s control. Facebook&rsquo;s case also highlights the <strong>zero-cost supply</strong> aspect: Facebook doesn&rsquo;t pay users to post content, much like Google doesn&rsquo;t pay websites to be indexed (<a href="https://stratechery.com/2015/aggregation-theory/#:~:text=Facebook%2C%20though%2C%20has%20built%20in,generated%20content%20networks%20are%20similar">Aggregation Theory &ndash; Stratechery by Ben Thompson</a>). By aggregating user-generated content and attention, Facebook became one of the world&rsquo;s most valuable companies, exemplifying how demand-side dominance leads to huge profits (despite none of the content costs that traditional media have to bear).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Amazon:</strong> Amazon started by disrupting retail (initially books) but evolved into an aggregator of retail <strong>demand</strong> across virtually every product category. Traditional retailers gained advantage by controlling local store networks and supplier relationships (inventory, supplier contracts, shelf placement). Amazon flipped this model by leveraging the Internet to <strong>modularize product distribution</strong>: first through e-commerce (any product shipped directly to the customer) and later through digital goods (e-books, streaming) that bypass physical distribution entirely (<a href="https://stratechery.com/2015/aggregation-theory/#:~:text=Amazon">Aggregation Theory &ndash; Stratechery by Ben Thompson</a>). Thompson explains that <em>&ldquo;Amazon modularized distribution &ndash; first via e-commerce and then via e-books&rdquo;</em>, breaking the hold publishers had on getting books to consumers (<a href="https://stratechery.com/2015/aggregation-theory/#:~:text=,to%20most%20of%20Amazon%E2%80%99s%20business">Aggregation Theory &ndash; Stratechery by Ben Thompson</a>). Having done so, Amazon <strong>integrated the customer relationship and data</strong> layer. It knows each customer&rsquo;s identity, purchase history, and payment information, which it links seamlessly to sales. Thompson notes that Amazon <em>&ldquo;integrated customer data and payment information with e-book distribution and its Amazon publishing initiative&rdquo;</em>, meaning Amazon could not only sell other publishers&rsquo; books, but even become a publisher itself and market directly to readers (<a href="https://stratechery.com/2015/aggregation-theory/#:~:text=,to%20most%20of%20Amazon%E2%80%99s%20business">Aggregation Theory &ndash; Stratechery by Ben Thompson</a>). More generally, <strong>Amazon&rsquo;s integration of a massive customer base with an everything-store</strong> allows it to introduce new products and services (from private labels to Amazon Prime media) and instantly reach millions of buyers. Amazon&rsquo;s marketplace extends this aggregator model: third-party merchants plug into Amazon&rsquo;s platform to reach customers, competing on price and selection while Amazon sits in the middle. In doing so, Amazon <strong>commoditizes the suppliers</strong> (the actual product brands or sellers become less important to the consumer than the fact that it&rsquo;s &ldquo;sold on Amazon&rdquo;) and <strong>aggregates the demand</strong> (customers come <em>to Amazon</em> first, rather than to individual merchants). This gives Amazon tremendous leverage over sellers &ndash; for instance, Amazon can increase fees, impose shipping requirements, or even create its own product lines to compete, and sellers have little choice but to comply because that&rsquo;s where the customers are. Thompson emphasizes that Amazon&rsquo;s core advantage in most of its businesses is the <strong>integration of distribution and customer data at scale</strong> (<a href="https://stratechery.com/2015/aggregation-theory/#:~:text=,to%20most%20of%20Amazon%E2%80%99s%20business">Aggregation Theory &ndash; Stratechery by Ben Thompson</a>). By owning the customer interface (website/app) and data, Amazon continually enhances convenience (one-click purchases, Prime free shipping, personalized recommendations), which in turn attracts more customers and sellers. It&rsquo;s a classic <strong>virtuous cycle</strong>. Amazon may not have a direct network effect like a social network, but it has a <strong>two-sided network effect</strong> &ndash; more buyers attract more sellers, and more sellers (more selection) attract more buyers. That feedback loop has helped Amazon consolidate a huge share of online retail demand. Traditional retailers, in contrast, are constrained by geography and inventory costs, and cannot easily match Amazon&rsquo;s personalized, data-driven shopping experience. Thus Amazon demonstrates how an aggregator can dominate an industry by <em>owning demand</em> (customers) even if it doesn&rsquo;t manufacture most of the products it sells.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Apple:</strong> Apple&rsquo;s case is interesting because Apple is not typically described as an &ldquo;aggregator&rdquo; in the same vein as the above companies &ndash; it&rsquo;s primarily a <strong>product company</strong> that monetizes by selling devices and software. However, Apple has applied Aggregation Theory principles in certain domains and has benefited from demand-side strength. Thompson often cites Apple to show the flip side of Christensen&rsquo;s disruption theory: Apple succeeded through tight <strong>vertical integration</strong> and superior user experience, which kept its products differentiated beyond the reach of modular imitators (<a href="https://stratechery.com/concept/disruption-theory/the-innovators-dilemma/#:~:text=Image%3A%20What%20Clayton%20Christensen%20Got,Wrong">The Innovator&rsquo;s Dilemma &ndash; Stratechery by Ben Thompson</a>). By making the iPhone so compelling to consumers, Apple actually gained leverage in areas where it wasn&rsquo;t traditionally strong. A prime example is how the <strong>iPhone aggregated consumer demand in the mobile industry</strong> to the point that mobile carriers had to bend to Apple&rsquo;s terms. Thompson illustrated (using Porter&rsquo;s Five Forces) that the <strong>bargaining power of iPhone customers</strong> forced telecom carriers to carry the iPhone and accept Apple&rsquo;s conditions (like subsidy models, revenue sharing, etc.), because customers would switch carriers just to get the iPhone (<a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/the-problem-with-aggregation-theory-demand-at-scale-supplier-power-and-value/#:~:text=,give%20in%20to%20Apple%E2%80%99s%20demands">The Problem with &ldquo;Aggregation Theory&rdquo;, Demand at Scale, Supplier Power and Value &ndash; Stratechery by Ben Thompson</a>). In his analysis, <em>&ldquo;the lack of iPhone [on a carrier] repels wireless buyers and drives them to rival carriers, forcing the holdouts to give in to Apple&rsquo;s demands.&rdquo;</em> (<a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/the-problem-with-aggregation-theory-demand-at-scale-supplier-power-and-value/#:~:text=,give%20in%20to%20Apple%E2%80%99s%20demands">The Problem with &ldquo;Aggregation Theory&rdquo;, Demand at Scale, Supplier Power and Value &ndash; Stratechery by Ben Thompson</a>) In other words, Apple <strong>aggregated consumer demand for its unique product</strong>, which gave it power over a formerly supplier-driven part of the value chain (cell service providers). This demand-centric power is very much in line with Aggregation Theory &ndash; even though Apple achieved it via a differentiated product rather than an open platform, the end result was similar: control over the customer relationship. Furthermore, with digital marketplaces like the <strong>App Store</strong>, Apple acts as an aggregator: it connects millions of iOS users to third-party developers and content providers. The App Store is a centralized platform where Apple has an <strong>exclusive relationship with iPhone customers at scale</strong>, and developers must go through Apple&rsquo;s distribution to reach those users. In doing so, Apple captures a 30% cut of transactions and can set the rules (much like other aggregators do in their ecosystems). Thompson has described how Apple&rsquo;s <strong>control of the App Store</strong> gives it immense influence (and has raised antitrust questions, as with any aggregator). Thus, while Apple&rsquo;s primary business is selling hardware (a supply-side model), the company leverages Aggregation Theory tactics within its ecosystem: it <strong>aggregates demand for mobile apps and media</strong> on its platforms and has a direct, ongoing relationship with its customer base. Notably, Apple&rsquo;s sustained success also vindicates Thompson&rsquo;s view that <strong>focusing on end-user experience can stave off disruption</strong> &ndash; Apple didn&rsquo;t get &ldquo;disrupted&rdquo; by low-end competitors as Christensen&rsquo;s model would predict, in part because Apple cultivated loyal demand through superior design, software, and services. In Aggregation Theory terms, Apple built a loyal user base (demand) that it can continually monetize (through device upgrades, services, App Store sales), illustrating that controlling demand can be as powerful as controlling supply.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these companies exemplifies aspects of Aggregation Theory. They <strong>prioritize building a huge user base and direct engagement</strong>, and only later worry about monetizing that base &ndash; often by taking a share from the suppliers who depend on their access to those users. As Thompson writes, <em>owning the consumer entry point</em> in an industry lets these firms &ldquo;modularize and commoditize their suppliers&rdquo; while expanding their reach (<a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/the-fang-playbook/#:~:text=Last%20July%20I%20described%20the,be%20found%20on%20the%20Internet">The FANG Playbook &ndash; Stratechery by Ben Thompson</a>) (<a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/the-fang-playbook/#:~:text=Profits%20,be%20found%20on%20the%20Internet">The FANG Playbook &ndash; Stratechery by Ben Thompson</a>). Over time, they integrate &ldquo;backwards&rdquo; into areas that used to be profit centers for incumbents (e.g. Facebook integrated into content distribution, Amazon into product fulfillment and logistics, Google into content aggregation, Netflix into content production, etc.), <strong>but all those moves are predicated on owning the customer relationship first</strong> (<a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/the-fang-playbook/#:~:text=Over%20time%2C%20each%20of%20the,on%20owning%20the%20customer%20relationship">The FANG Playbook &ndash; Stratechery by Ben Thompson</a>). This is a reversal of the old strategy where incumbents integrated forward into distribution. Thompson often refers to these tech giants as <strong>&ldquo;super-aggregators&rdquo;</strong>, especially Google and Facebook, because they operate at such scale and with such light marginal costs that they tend toward monopoly-like dominance (<a href="https://stratechery.com/aggregation-theory/#:~:text=">Aggregation Theory &ndash; Stratechery by Ben Thompson</a>). In fact, Thompson argues that the &ldquo;end game&rdquo; of Aggregation Theory is monopoly &ndash; aggregators so completely control demand that they become the gatekeepers of their industries (<a href="https://stratechery.com/aggregation-theory/#:~:text=">Aggregation Theory &ndash; Stratechery by Ben Thompson</a>). This has raised new challenges around antitrust, since traditional competition measures (market share in supply of a product) don&rsquo;t neatly apply to platforms that give consumers free services while aggregating other markets.</p>
<h2>Christensen&rsquo;s Theory Evolved for the Internet Age</h2>
<p>In developing Aggregation Theory, Ben Thompson did not discard Christensen&rsquo;s Disruption Theory so much as <strong>extend it</strong> to account for the Internet&rsquo;s impact on distribution, scale, and consumer behavior. Christensen&rsquo;s core insight &ndash; that value and profit migrate in predictable ways when technology changes &ndash; is very much present. Thompson explicitly grounded Aggregation Theory in Christensen&rsquo;s <strong>Conservation of Attractive Profits</strong>, showing that when distribution became cheap and modular, the <strong>attractive profits &ldquo;conserved&rdquo; in the system moved to the aggregator that integrated the remaining point of scarcity: the user relationship</strong> (<a href="https://stratechery.com/2015/aggregation-theory/#:~:text=,also%20fit%20the%20%E2%80%9CConservation%20of">Aggregation Theory &ndash; Stratechery by Ben Thompson</a>) (<a href="https://stratechery.com/2015/aggregation-theory/#:~:text=The%20result%20is%20the%20shift,For%20example">Aggregation Theory &ndash; Stratechery by Ben Thompson</a>). Moreover, Thompson&rsquo;s emphasis on <strong>business model alignment</strong> (aggregators often use new monetization models like advertising or subscriptions that incumbents didn&rsquo;t have) and on <strong>scale advantages</strong> builds on Christensen&rsquo;s work by highlighting factors that have become critical in modern markets (e.g. the importance of global scale, network effects, and software leverage).</p>
<p>Where Christensen focused on how nimble entrants could disrupt complacent incumbents via cheaper, &ldquo;good enough&rdquo; offerings, Thompson showed that in the tech era, incumbents could also be outmaneuvered by entrants that attack from <strong>above or the side &ndash; by aggregating demand with a better experience or convenience</strong>, even if initially those entrants don&rsquo;t compete on price or low-end features. The theories are complementary: many aggregators were not classic disruptors in the Christensen sense (<a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/the-fang-playbook/#:~:text=Note%20that%20none%20of%20these,only%20when%20the%20aggregators%E2%80%99%20consumer">The FANG Playbook &ndash; Stratechery by Ben Thompson</a>), yet they <em>did</em> disrupt the existing value distribution in their industries. Thompson acknowledges that <strong>Christensen&rsquo;s frameworks remain powerful for understanding competition</strong>, but by integrating concepts like user experience, demand concentration, and network effects, Thompson provides a more applicable lens for companies whose power comes from controlling interfaces and data rather than manufacturing products.</p>
<p>In conclusion, Ben Thompson&rsquo;s Aggregation Theory can be seen as <strong>Christensen&rsquo;s Disruption Theory adapted to a world of zero distribution costs and ubiquitous connectivity</strong>. Thompson clearly links the evolution of his thinking to Christensen&rsquo;s foundation &ndash; repeatedly citing Christensen&rsquo;s influence and concepts &ndash; while explaining phenomena that Christensen&rsquo;s original theory struggled with. The result is a rich analysis of modern business models: Aggregation Theory explains why companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Apple have become so dominant by aggregating users and leveraging demand-side economies of scale, in contrast to traditional firms that moated themselves around supply. As Thompson puts it, in today&rsquo;s markets the user is king, and those who <strong>aggregate the users</strong> wield the ultimate power (<a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/the-problem-with-aggregation-theory-demand-at-scale-supplier-power-and-value/#:~:text=That%20is%20precisely%20the%20point,to%20gain%20power%20over%20supply">The Problem with &ldquo;Aggregation Theory&rdquo;, Demand at Scale, Supplier Power and Value &ndash; Stratechery by Ben Thompson</a>). The shift from supply-side to demand-side control is the defining economic change of the Internet age, and it&rsquo;s exactly what Thompson&rsquo;s Aggregation Theory, standing on the shoulders of Christensen&rsquo;s work, illuminates for us (<a href="https://stratechery.com/2015/aggregation-theory/#:~:text=The%20result%20is%20the%20shift,For%20example">Aggregation Theory &ndash; Stratechery by Ben Thompson</a>) (<a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/the-problem-with-aggregation-theory-demand-at-scale-supplier-power-and-value/#:~:text=That%20is%20precisely%20the%20point,to%20gain%20power%20over%20supply">The Problem with &ldquo;Aggregation Theory&rdquo;, Demand at Scale, Supplier Power and Value &ndash; Stratechery by Ben Thompson</a>).</p>
