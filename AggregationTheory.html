  <h1>Ben Thompson’s Aggregation Theory and Christensen’s Disruption: An Evolution in Strategy</h1>

  <p><strong>Aggregation Theory</strong> is a framework by Ben Thompson (Stratechery) explaining how modern tech companies dominate by controlling the demand side (users), not the supply side (producers). It builds upon <strong>Clayton Christensen</strong>’s <em>Disruption Theory</em>, which focuses on how new entrants disrupt incumbents by starting with underserved or low-end markets.</p>

  <h2>1. Christensen’s Disruption Theory</h2>
  <p>Christensen’s theory explains how smaller companies with simpler, cheaper solutions can unseat dominant players by targeting overlooked segments. Over time, disruptors improve their products and eventually displace incumbents.</p>
  <blockquote>
    “Disruption describes a process whereby a smaller company with fewer resources is able to successfully challenge established incumbent businesses.” – Christensen
  </blockquote>

  <h2>2. Thompson’s Adaptation: The Birth of Aggregation Theory</h2>
  <p>Ben Thompson saw that this model didn’t explain the rise of companies like Google, Facebook, or Apple, which didn’t start at the low end. Instead, they succeeded by aggregating users and owning the customer interface.</p>
  <p>Inspired by Christensen’s <strong>Law of Conservation of Attractive Profits</strong>, Thompson noticed that as the Internet commoditized supply and distribution, profit shifted to demand-side aggregators – companies that control access to users.</p>

  <h2>3. Key Concepts of Aggregation Theory</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Direct User Relationships</strong>: Aggregators bypass intermediaries and engage users directly.</li>
    <li><strong>Zero Marginal Costs</strong>: Digital goods can be delivered at scale with no extra cost.</li>
    <li><strong>Demand Aggregation</strong>: The key power lies in consolidating user attention, not owning supply.</li>
    <li><strong>Network Effects</strong>: More users create more value, attracting even more users and suppliers.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Examples of Aggregators</h2>
  <h3>Google</h3>
  <p>Aggregates demand for information. Publishers optimize for Google, not the other way around. Monetized via search ads.</p>

  <h3>Facebook</h3>
  <p>Aggregates attention through user-generated content. Monetizes via targeted ads. Users are the content suppliers.</p>

  <h3>Amazon</h3>
  <p>Aggregates retail demand. Sellers rely on Amazon’s marketplace to reach customers. Integrates logistics and customer data.</p>

  <h3>Apple</h3>
  <p>Though a product company, Apple aggregates demand via iOS and the App Store. Controls access to its users and monetizes through hardware, services, and commissions.</p>

  <h2>5. Thompson’s Evolution of Christensen’s Ideas</h2>
  <p>Thompson extended Christensen’s theory to account for the Internet’s radical reduction in distribution costs. He showed how control has shifted from the supply side (manufacturing, distribution) to the demand side (user experience, platforms).</p>
  <blockquote>
    “In today’s markets, the user is king, and those who aggregate the users wield the ultimate power.” – Ben Thompson
